## Major Problems?



## Helpful?
Yes, it helped a lot to understand how neural networks work. Building each part (sigmoid, ReLU) step by step was good for learning. The visualization part made the theory more clear.


## Duration (hours)?
[3.5, 4, 3.5]

## Other feedback?
Tests were helpful for checking if code works. Good comments in starter code helped understand what to do.
